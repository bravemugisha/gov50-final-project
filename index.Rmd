## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the process of recursive government. This explores the ways in which a civic engagement in government for the common person is not merely through elections, but through process such as petitions, town hall discussions, etc. In other words, I am interested in data that shows how people interact with their government other than through elections.

I am also interested in data about Africa.
